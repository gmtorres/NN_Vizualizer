# Basic Neural Network Visualizer


Basic Neural Network Visualizer allowing interaction and experimentation with a simple model of a Feedforward Neural Network, while explaining each step and the fundamental processes of Neural Networks, like feedforward and backpropagation. This project aims to help understand how neural networks works at the lower level and foster curiosity for learning more on this topic.
